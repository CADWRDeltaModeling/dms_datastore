Prerequisites
-------------

The repository depends on :doc:`vtools3 <vtools3:index>`, matlplotlib and several downloading, processing and visualization libraries.

Conda
-----

The easiest way to install the library is using conda (typically minicoda). Some hints for using conda tools and channels 
for our libraries or for doing a developmer install are given here [ref]. Assuming you follow those instructions for 
setting up channels, the minimal installation is::

  $ conda install dms_datastore

We recommend that you do a conda installation even if you follow it up with a developer install using pip.
